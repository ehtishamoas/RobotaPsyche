## Presentation Content
My presentation focused on the impacts of experiencing emotions on morality of robots.
In the presentation, I first discussed the importance of ethics in robots as they are being employed in a range of fields from nursing to military. 
And so, if they are to act morally in our society, they need emotions like empathy (to show compassion) and fear (e.g. of punishments) in addition to the ability
to reason. Then, I explored concerns regarding emotional robots like it can be very difficult for robots to deal with emotions and their extent as we know even
humans suffer from this problem. Also, even ‘good’ emotions like empathy can make robots commit unethical tasks. So, I concluded that the ability to find the right 
balance between rationality and emotions is crucial if robots are to act morally while navigating complex human society norms.

## Discussion
Class gave very good examples of how a good emotion can make us do something ethically wrong like self-defense/protecting someone can cause a robot to cause 
extreme damage to opposing party, or patriotism can turn into fanaticism. We discussed how a pack of balanced emotions, although too complicated to determine, is crucial 
to turn a robot into an ideal human being. And we would also need to be able to control the extent to which robots can feel a certain emotion. For instance, a mix of 
love, anger, and fear and their specific extents allow parents to make right decisions for their children. Moreover, we discussed the need to develop an autonomous 
system where robots can give priority to either reasoning or emotions based on circumstances. 
Regarding my question that will it be unethical of us to control a robot’s emotions, general consensus was that since they have emotions now, they must also have
rights and free will as humans does. However, one interesting perspective was that we can think of them like our pets who we sometimes neuter for their own good. 
So, we will be responsible for them and will need to be in control to ensure their and our own wellbeing.
