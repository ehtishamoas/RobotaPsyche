### Course Summary
Robota Psyche was the most thought-provoking and engaging course I have ever taken during my time at college. Both the technical and philosophical aspects of the 
course gave me new perspectives on many topics related to robotics. 

## Technical Aspect
In terms of the technical part of the course, I was fascinated by the idea of looking at the simple motions of robots as if they are mimicking a behavior of a living 
creature. For example, a vehicle that moves away from incident light seems to imitate a cockroach’s behavior that always prefers dark areas. It broadened my narrow 
perspective of Artificial Intelligence (AI), as for me, AI was simply algorithms made by humans which could not have/represent any personality. I never though how 
simple robotic motions, especially when integrated together, can express something so detailed and powerful as the real-world ecosystems. The reading assignments of
a first few chapters of 'Vehicles' (by Braitenberg) and coding assignments based on 'The Nature of Code' (by Prof. Shiffman) taught me how to really think outside the
box as a programmer and what wonderful things are possible with even the basic coding concepts. I really loved the mid-term project assignment where we were given a
motivation to either imitate real-world creatures or even fictional creatures by creating "vehicles" in Processing 3 and giving them a personality based on
their behaviors (steering, arriving, separating, flocking, etc.). While working on my mid-term project about cat and mice ecosystem, I could not stop myself from
adding more and more behaviors to simulate cat and mice behaviors and their interactions. The part I loved most was that my peers and Prof. Shiloh could observe 
behaviors in my project that I did not even think about or that I perceived as mistakes while I was coding. I also really enjoyed observing my peer’s projects.
Although all the projects were developed using similar coding mechanisms (based on The Nature of Code), there were quite different from one another and all of
them exhibited a fascinating ecosystem.

## Readings, Presentations, and Discussions
I think that readings, presentations, and discussions were very meaningful and rewarding part of the course. I learnt a lot from each reading and loved how engaging
and insightful the discussions were. In my opinion, the reading material and all the videos were very well-chosen as they allowed us to explore both current and past
human perception of robots and AI through a blend of fiction, non-fiction, history, and academic materials. All my peers who lead a discussion posed very 
thought-provoking questions and everyone in the class would bring new ideas and perspectives to the table regarding every topic. What I mean with the ‘new ideas’ 
is that I had never thought about them before. The reading assignments of Asimov’s I, Robot, especially Reason were very interesting as they discussed very important
topics regarding robots through science fiction. For instance, I, like many others, was always apprehensive of the idea that robots would start to disobey humans and
that would be our downfall. This reading and the discussion broadened my perspective regarding the ability of robots to disobey ethically wrong human commands. 
The topics that I found most thought-provoking were moral agency of robots. Even after the end of our class, I would stay engrossed in the topics such as what would
blaming and punishment mean for robots, the role of intentionality and free will for moral agency of robots, trust in robots vs trust in humans, etc. The topic of
moral agency was discussed in many readings and presentations (including my own) with a link to different topics (like consciousness, emotions, and trust in robots).
Actually, all these topics were very inter-connected. Through readings and presentations, we explored these topics by focusing on one at a time which proved 
to be quite helpful in stimulating thought-provoking discussions. We discussed many important ideas regarding robots’ psyche which include emotions, religion, 
ethics, slavery, consciousness, and warfare. Exploring these topics did not just allowed us to learn more about robota psyche, but also made us reflect upon our 
own psyche as well. For instance, when talking about punishments for robots, we discussed why punishments are effective in a human society and how they might be
ineffective for robots if they don't have an ability to sense fear. Similarly, while discussing emotions in robots, we first explored what emotions mean for us and
what are the theories of emotions.

## Conclusion
Robota Psyche course changed the way I looked at robots and AI programming. The course gave me an opportunity to think about and discuss ideas and questions in 
robotics that are often neglected. It also made me realize the importance of such thoughts and discussions in our efforts to make right decisions regarding
current and future development of AI technology.
