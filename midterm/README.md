## Midterm Project:
For my midterm project, I plan to elaborate on my Feb 14 "cats and mice" ecology. The canvas will act as a room which includes a small house for mice. There will be
a cat roaming freely within the room. I plan to implement its random movement using _Perlin Noise._ 

Cats and mice will have random mass given at the beginning of program and their maximum speed and size wil depend on that mass. Mice will also reproduce and have a limited
lifespan. Cat will not have a limited lifespan because they have nine lives (just kidding ðŸ˜†). The reason for no lifespan for cats is that this ecosystem shows a small room
and if we are not reproducing cats, we should not let it die.

The cat will be able to detect mice if they are in a certain radius from it. On detection, it will chase the mice and eat them if caught. However, it cannot enter into a
mice house. 

Mice will try not to leave their house unless they can smell food and cat it at safe distance from that food. But, mice will become more aggressive and less hesitant to take
a risk to get food as they become more and more hungry. Other mice will be afraid of the one whose hunger and aggression reaches very high levels because cannibalism exists in
mice.

Food will continue to be spawned in the room at some random place after some random time. The scent of food will be implemented using _flow field._
